"""
Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in
ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in
functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the
smallest space complexity possible.

Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
    -5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104

def sortArray(nums):

print(sortArray([5,2,3,1])) # [1,2,3,4,5]
print(sortArray([5,1,1,2,0,0])) # [0,0,1,1,2,5]
