"""
You are given two 0-indexed arrays nums and cost consisting each of n positive integers.

You can do the following operation any number of times:

Increase or decrease any element of the array nums by 1.
The cost of doing one operation on the ith element is cost[i].

Return the minimum total cost such that all the elements of the array nums become equal.
