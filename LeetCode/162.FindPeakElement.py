"""
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element,
and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks,
return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words,
an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a
neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Constraints

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.
