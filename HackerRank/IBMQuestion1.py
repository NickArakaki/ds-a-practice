An analyst is analyzing a stock over a period of n days. The price of the stock on the ith day is price[i],
and the profit obtained is denoted by profit[i]. The analyst wants to pick a triplet of days (i,j,k) such that
(i < j < k) adn price[i] < price[j] < price[k] in such a way that the total profit, i.e. profit[i] + profit[j] + profit[k]
is maximized.
Find the maximum total profit possible, if there is no valid triplet, return -1
