/*
    Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated charcters.
    For example, the string 'aabcccccaaa' would become 'a2b1c5a3'. If the "compressed" string would not
    become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can
    assume that the string only has upper and lower case letters (a-z)
